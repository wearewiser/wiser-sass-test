# The task

This screenshot below has been taken from a web design put together by the design team here at Wiser. The aim of this task is to replicate this design as accurately as possible by writing HTML and SASS.

![Alt text](src/assets/design.png)

- Each box should have a hover state which increases the scale, changes the background and reveals additional text (the revealed text can be the same on each box).
- Feel free to create a new component if you wish, otherwise use the app.component files already in the repo.
- Build a desktop version only, don't worry about responsive design
- Don't worry about changing the font
- The colours should match the design, although it doesn't need to be perfect

Bonus task:

- Animate the transition to and from the hover state for a better user experience
