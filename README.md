# The task

This screenshot below has been taken from a web design put together by the design team here at Wiser. The aim of this task is to replicate this design as accurately as possible by writing HTML and SASS.

There are a few different stages to the test - you should complete is as much as you can but don't worry if you can't finish the task. 

1. Create the static 3 boxes that line up next to each other and try to match the design as closely as possible. 2 purple boxes and one white. 
2. Make this responsive for all screen sizes.
3. Add a hover state so that the 3 boxes are purple until you hover over one and it changes to white (as shown on the center box). Each box can have the same content and hover state.


- Feel free to create a new component if you wish, otherwise use the app.component files already in the repo.
- Don't worry about changing the font.
- The colours should match the design, although it doesn't need to be perfect
